# Carbon-FootTracker
Develop a Sage Carbon footprint tracker which gives rewards (points/coins) based on
positive environmental decisions. The reason behind this is for Sage colleagues to promote
recycling, litter picking and other things that may help the environment and reward those
who do. The idea is to encourage colleagues to work together to create an environmentally
friendly working environment.
Basic requirements:

 A user interface should be created to allow users to add their reusable things
(straws/tupperware/reusable cutlery)
 A user should be allowed to select if they have user reusable things and provide
points based on. This.
 Daily achievements should be notified to the user.
 The system will allow users to set a personal target of how many items they will
recycle/how many times avoid using a car to reach a location in a period of time,
 It will track your journeys if the journey is not in the car it will give bonus points. This
can be done based on time taken.
 Allows users to add a list of items recycled
 Will add points when reusable things are used e.g. straws/Tupperware/cutlery
